# data_augmented_BERT-pair
Here you can find the code for BERT-pair with data augmentation. Keyboard augmentation, back translation and easy data augmentation.

Data Augmentation for a BERT-pair model. In order to use the code please follow the following steps:

1. Go to https://github.com/HSLCY/ABSA-BERT-pair and follow the steps on the github page. We use large parts of their code to run BERT-pair.
2. First run the benchmark model
3. Then use the methods in the folder "data_augmentation" to create additional positive pairs.
5. After running the data augmentation you can use the additional positive pairs to train BERT-pair.
